          I am graduated from
          <a href="http://endustri.uludag.edu.tr/tr/index.php/tr/">Uludag University Industrial Engineering</a>
          with
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFy8_w7ZFKk&t=5s">degree</a>.
          Our

            graduation Project
          </a>
          was a data analysis study.
          The contribution of graduation Project to me was understanding importance of
          big data, the way of collecting data, statistics, algorithm and the steps
          to be followed in a data analysis study.
          <br>
          <br>
          I had a opportunity to work into more than one department both before the
          graduation and after the graduation. I had work experience in method,
          planning and logistics departments until today. While working in the method
          department, I took an active role in Poke-Yoke, Kaizen and 5S studies and
          understood the importance of order in the working environment. The company
          switched to the new ERP system during I was working in the planning
          department, I was involved in the infrastructure preparations of the system.
          Today, I am responsible of both material planning and intra logistics.
          These responsibilities contributed to me with understanding the importance
          of frequent and regular follow-up, the link between production and
          management, as well as the necessity of automation.
